slide notes for DPG

outline what alignment is for the viewer
-> show pictures of ideal detector vs possible real detector with rotations and movements
talk about survey in 1 or 2 slides

1. using tracking script to study Q2 behaviour
2. additional to the TrackSelector added more stuff to FTTrackSelector to study quarters individually
3. in doing so, it became clear, hat Q0 is problematic and not Q2
-> plot for individual layers for hits on tracks (nodeX vs nodeY)
4. trackslopes in x (tx) show gaussian as per usual but in Q0 we see a small bump in the slopes
5. general performance improvement from v1 to v2 seen in nodeX (hits on tracks in x)
--> way better in A side, a little worse on C side
6. also seen when plotting chi2 versus phi
-> we want a flat sitribution overall: A side good, C side lower for small angles
7. 25.01. RTA nice presentation:
7.1: tx < -0.09 bump
C side quarters way better performing
8. 11 min hits instead of 9: not much different but less events overall
9. shapes are similar: cut only useful if we need more events
10. T2X2 in globalModuleIndex has VERY few hits
11. tx vs nodeX: how are are the track slopes for these hits on tracks?
12. 08.02.: horrendous T2X2: onto that
13. seeding tracks in simulation close to identical to from v2 -> alignment tracks problematic
14. err residual: 3 peak feature in seeding and sim, 2 peaks in alignment tracks
15. 15.02.: mean residual for each layer for performance evaluation -> weighted with nHits per layer vs
total hits per layer to reduce impact from layers with fewer/more hits
16. individual residuals per layer
17. plan on modifying xmls bc we are quite sure alignment or survey are the issue for T2X2
18. photogrammetry: sun heating on T2X1 and T2U
